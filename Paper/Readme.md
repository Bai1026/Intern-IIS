# This is the readme of my part in this paper
My part is to traini a **GNN model** and the **embedding model** to detect the malicious behavior in the system log.  
Including 2 part, which are **DARPA** and **syntheszed** dataset generated by others in the team.

## How to Execute?
1. use python 3.8.10
2. For **embedding**: `pip install embedding_requirements.txt`
3. For **training**: `pip install DGL_requirements.txt`
4. For each, you need to get the word embedding from either openke or secureBERT  
   - I used TransR, TransE and TransH in this project
   - For further information, u can check the github of openke and secureBERT
6. Then you would need to construct the DGL graph for GNN model with node and edge feature replaced by the embedding you get in the former step
