By publishing this information, we hope to minimize \nthe damage of future cyber attacks and strengthen the global security posture. \nMAJOR EVENTS IMPACTING CYBERSECURITY IN 2020\nThe most obvious cybersecurity event of the year was COVID-19. The pandemic created many opportunities \nfor threat actors. Businesses worldwide struggled to implement secure work-from-home policies while \nthe public weathered multiple COVID-19-themed attacks.\nMercenary threat groups also experienced another year of growth as unscrupulous actors and \norganizations outsourced their cyber attacks. Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) offerings continued \nto grow in popularity, replacing the traditional off-the-shelf ransomware attacks seen in previous years. \nOff-the-shelf toolkits were still active throughout the year, simplifying cyber attacks with ready-made \nexploit kits, malspam campaigns, and threat emulation software like Cobalt Strike.\nCryptocurrency also had a strong year. Bitcoin hitting new price highs in January 2021 may signal an \nupcoming increase in ransomware and cryptojacking attacks.\n33EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nCYBERSECURITY ISSUES IN 2020 AND 2021 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nElection security was a topic of great interest in 2020.
